## Ames Iowa Housing ML Analysis
Using the data from the kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stat101ahouseprice/overview 

The data was cleaned, exploratory data analysis was performed, and  ML models which try to accurately predict the sale price given the features were generated.  Both linear and tree based models were developed. Please review the slides from the presentation and the notebooks in this repo for a clearer understanding of the steps taken.
